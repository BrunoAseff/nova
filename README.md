## Nova

Nova is a calm and customizable space designed to help you focus, relax, or just take a break. Each one of the three tabs Home, Focus, and Relax can be personalized with tools like timers, ambient sounds, reminders, breathing exercises, quotes, background themes and more. No pressure, no clutter, just a place to tune into whatever you need in the moment.

It works especially well as a second screen or a quiet space on your computer during study sessions, something you can leave open to stay grounded and avoid distractions.
